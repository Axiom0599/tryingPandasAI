Pandas is like the superhero of data manipulation, leaving Julia and R in the dust when it comes to user-friendliness.

Pandas is often preferred over Julia or R because it's easy to use. Tasks like indexing, concatenating, melting, pivoting, and cross-tabulations can all be done in just one line of code with Pandas, saving you time and effort compared to other packages. While it may lack a bit of elegance, its simplicity makes it enjoyable to work with.

Additionally, pandasai enhances Pandas with generative AI capabilities. This library allows you to summarize data in a more human-like way by leveraging generative AI techniques. However, the catch is that access to pandasai requires the premium version of OpenAI.
